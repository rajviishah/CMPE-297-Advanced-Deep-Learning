<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>a) Reptile MAML Algorithm Implementation</h2>

Task: Implement a colab for  reptile MAML algorithm in keras/tensorflow  for meta learning on a small dataset from scratch (the goal is to learn data set preparation step, meta learning concepts etc,.)

CMPE 297 - Assignment 4 - Part a.ipynb: I have applied Reptile Algorithm on Omniglot dataset. The colab is descriptive and detailed with the processes of data preparation, visualization of data, defining hyperparameters, building the model using reptile algorithm, and visualizing results

<h2>b) Prototypical Networks for Meta Learning</h2>

Task: Implement a colab for meta learning using prototypical networks in pytorch

<h2>c) Meta Learning and BERT</h2>

Task: Implement a colab of  metalearning on top of BERT
