<h2>4) DiT Document Layout Analysis</h2>
- It is a self-supervised pre-trained Document Image Transformer model to predict labels on a pdf document. For example, detecting tables, text, images, etc. The demo required a pdf document, and the rest is up to the powerful model to highlight various parts of the document.

- Steps to execute the demo:
  
  - Visit: https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/dit-document-layout-analysis

<h2>5) Chef Transformer</h2>
- to generate recipes based on chef, food style, and ingredients. If you are hungry and have limited food options, then type the ingredients and get the recipe for delicious food. This is my most favorite app as it is visually appealing with a unique use case.

<h2>6) ArcaneGAN Video</h2>
- uses flavored u-net trained on Arcane anime dataset, and images are generated via a blended stylegan2. Learn more about the model implementation here. For this Gradio demo, you just need to upload a sample video and let the model do the magic. The output video will be in Arcane anime style.

<h2>7) OCR For Captcha</h2>
- It was trained on a combination of CNN and RNN with an endpoint layer for implementing CTC loss. To learn in-depth about model training, check out Keras's code example. The app asked you to upload an image of a captcha and return highly accurate alphanumeric text.
